# ShowWork

![ShowWork Logo](./assets/logo.png)

ShowWork is a portfolio application with built‑in, ready‑to‑use themes. Each user gets a personal, shareable URL in the format:

`https://showwork.in/<user_name>`

Anyone can open your link to view your work, projects, and profile in a clean, responsive layout.

## Highlights

- Built‑in portfolio themes that look great out of the box
- Simple publishing flow with a dedicated username URL
- Mobile‑first, performant pages for easy sharing
- Customizable sections (About, Projects, Skills, Contact)
- SEO‑friendly structure and social preview support

## How It Works

1. Pick a username (e.g., `kanishk`), which becomes your public link: `https://showwork.in/kanish`.
2. Choose a theme from the gallery.
3. Add your content (bio, projects, links, socials).
4. Publish — your portfolio is live and shareable.
